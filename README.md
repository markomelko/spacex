# Project details

    This was originally my first ReactJS project, maybe I continue development during autumn 2019

    Space is interesting thing and Elon Musk's SpaceX project is huge
    Application uses Space X API https://api.spacexdata.com

    I am going to create better version of this, that looks more interesting and has something calculations of offered data. Maybe I also use some another data sources like Nasa?
